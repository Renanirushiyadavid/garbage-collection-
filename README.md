## comparing Cheney's algorithm and mark compact algorithm with c++


Comparing Cheney's algorithm and Mark-compact algorithm with C++ and demonstrating which is better 
I compared the two algorithms and found a solution. 
which is better and why? 
which are garbage collections.
Two algorithms are compared which comes under garbage collection.
